Overdraft charges are fees that banks or financial institutions charge when an account balance goes below zero. Here’s an overview of common overdraft charges and how they typically work:
1. Overdraft Fees

    Flat Fees: A fixed fee is charged each time a transaction causes an overdraft, such as $35 per overdraft transaction.
    Daily Fees: Some banks add an extra daily fee until the overdraft is paid off, often around $5–$10 per day.

2. Extended Overdraft Fees

    Sustained Overdraft Fees: A fee for accounts that remain overdrawn for a prolonged period, usually after 5–7 days.
    Additional Interest: If an overdraft is technically a short-term loan, the bank might charge interest on the amount overdrawn.

3. Non-sufficient Funds (NSF) Fees

    If a transaction cannot be covered and is declined, NSF fees may apply. Some banks may charge both an overdraft and NSF fee on the same transaction.

4. Overdraft Protection Transfer Fees

    With overdraft protection, banks may automatically transfer money from a linked account to cover an overdraft, charging a smaller fee than the standard overdraft fee, typically around $10–$12.

Ways to Minimize Overdraft Charges

    Set Up Alerts to notify when your balance is low.
    Opt-Out of overdraft services for debit card transactions.
    Consider Overdraft Protection, which can reduce costs if you frequently go over your balance.
