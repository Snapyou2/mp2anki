This lesson explains overdraft charges, which are fees imposed by banks when an account\'s balance drops below zero. It outlines various types of overdraft fees, including flat fees per overdraft transaction, daily fees for each day an account stays overdrawn, extended overdraft fees for prolonged negative balances, and non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees for declined transactions. The lesson also describes overdraft protection, a service that can help avoid high overdraft fees by automatically transferring funds from a linked account to cover overdrafts, albeit for a smaller fee. Additionally, it provides strategies to minimize overdraft charges, such as setting up low-balance alerts, opting out of overdraft services for debit card transactions, and considering overdraft protection if overdrafts are frequent.
